## Overview

This project is a modification for the SpotMicroAI quadruped project, a 4-legged open source robot.
There are a few modification but the baseline quadruped is the SpotMicroAI.
The most important key points of this design:

* It runs with ROS
* It won't use super expensive motors but it will try to be energetically efficient
